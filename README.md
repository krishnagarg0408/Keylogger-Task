# Task-04: Python Keylogger 🧠⌨️

This project is part of my Cybersecurity Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.  
It is a **Python-based Keylogger** that captures and logs keystrokes into a file.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Log all user keystrokes using Python
- Save the data into a `.txt` file for later analysis

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses the `pynput` Python library to monitor keyboard inputs
- Captures every key pressed and logs it into a text file
- Special keys like space, enter, etc., are marked accordingly

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

---

## 🧾 Files Included

- `keylogger.py` – Python code to capture keystrokes
- `keystrokes_log.txt` – Output file (auto-created when script runs)
- Screenshot(s) of script and output
